# Search and Sort

This section is all about Sorting and Searching data. You will learn how to sort and create your own Data Structures.

## Get to know the plumbing?

When we write code in JavaScript it’s at quite a high level. A lot of things are taken care of for us by the infrastructure. There are lots of things that we don’t have to care about and we can just get on and write some code.

It’s like when we open a tap, the water just comes out. Behind the scenes there are pipes that are connected to a water source. We call these pipes plumbing, but this plumbing stays almost invisible to us. That is until the drain is blocked...

JavaScript provide a lot of digital plumbing to us: all that we do is create a list and add data into it. We can add, sort, and retrieve data from a list without thinking about it much.

We will be exploring a bit more of this plumbing to give us a better understanding of how computers do things.

## Assumption about knowledge

We assume at this stage that you are confident with using JavaScript Arrays (lists) and Mapsm and you are comfortable with loops, conditional statements and functions.

We also assume that you have already helped Nelisa to find her most and least popular products and categories.

If not stop right here and come back once you are comfortable with all the above.
