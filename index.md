# Search and Sort

This section is all about Sorting and Searching data. You will learn how to sort and create your own Data Structures

## Get to know the plumbing?

When we write code in Javascript it’s at quite a high level and a lot of things taken care for, for us by the infrastructure. There are lots of things that we don’t have to care about and we can just get on and write some code.

It’s like when we open a tap, the water just comes out - behind the scene there are pipes that is connected to a water source of sort. We call these pipes plumbing, but this plumbing stays almost invisible to us. That is until the drain is blocked…

Javascript provide a lot of digital plumbing to us - all that we do is create a list and add data into it. We can add, sort and retrieve data from a list without thinking about it much.

We will be exploring a bit more of this plumbing to give us a better understanding of how computers do things.

## Assumption about knowledge

We assume at this stage that you are confident with using Javascript Arrays(Lists) and Maps.

And that you already helped Nelisa to find her most & least popular products and categories. You also told her what her most popular product and category was. We assume you are comfortable with loops, conditional statements and functions.

If not stop right here and come back once you are comfortable with all the above.
