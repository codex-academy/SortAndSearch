# Introduction

We will be working with Data Structures extensively in this section. We will use JavaScript Arrays a lot. We will discover why a JavaScript Array is not really an Array in the truest sense of the word, but more like a List. You will also learn how to create your own Data Structures in JavaScript. Soon you will be creating and sorting your own Lists in JavaScript.

## Letâ€™s do a few warm-up exercises

Write code and unit tests for the functions below.

### Swap first two

Create a function that takes a list as a parameter and swap the first entry in the list with the second entry in the list and returns the resulting list.

Given a list :

```javascript
['apple', 'pear', 'mango', 'banana']
```

It should return :

```javascript
['pear', 'apple', 'mango', 'banana']
```

### Swap first and last

Create a function that takes a list as a parameter and swap the first entry in the list with the last entry in the list and returns the resulting list.

Given a list :

```javascript
['apple', 'pear', 'mango', 'banana']
```    

It should return :

```javascript
['banana', 'apple', 'mango', 'apple']
```    

### Know they neighbour

Create a function that takes a list of numbers and compares each number with its neighbour to the right. If a number is bigger than its neighbour on the right, it should swap with its neighbour. The function should return the new list. What is the result of this function? Where does the biggest number end up?

Use this data :

```javascript
[5, 19, 7, 17, 6, 1, 3]
```
