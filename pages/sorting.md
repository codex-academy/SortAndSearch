# Sorting

Sorting a list in JavaScript is as easy as calling the `sort` function. You can specify how it should be sorted by passing in a command function. What is it doing behind the scenes, though?

A basic sort function might compare each value in a list with each other and then swap the values around until there are no more values to be swapped.

# Sorting algorithms

There are various different sorting algorithms. An algorithm is a set of steps to achieve a certain goal or outcome. Some sorting algorithms are more efficient than others: they take less steps to complete sorting the data. The steps are how many times the algorithm needs to inspect the data to ensure the data is sorted.

## Selection sort

Selection sort is very similar to finding the most popular or least popular product for Nelisa. You donâ€™t stop once you find the smallest/largest product, though: you keep going until you ordered all the values in the list.

## Bubble sort

When doing a Bubble sort the biggest or smallest number bubbles towards the end of the list. It's comparing each item in a list to the item next to it, and swapping the items around if needed. When there are no more items to swap the list is sorted.

**Todo:**

Add sorting support to your LinkedList class. Be sure that you can sort ascending or descending.
