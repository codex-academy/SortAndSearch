# Assessments

## Formative assessment 1

Learn how to manipulate values in a collection. Introducing candidates to the concept of using temporary variables.

Swap entries in a List. Swap the first and the second entry in a list. Swap the first and the last entries in a List.

Compare values in a List with each other. Keep on swapping the entry that are bigger than the entry on the right of the current value.

## Formative assessment 2

Explore Linked Lists foundations.

Learn how to manipulate entries in a Linked List.

### Working with Nodes and pointers

Given a LinkedList of Node objects print out all the entries in the list. Swap the first and second entry. Swap the last and first entries in the list of Nodes. Discover how to know when the end of a Linked List is reached.

Compare and move values around in a list of Linked Nodes.

## Formative assessment 3

Create a useable LinkedList Object that is using `Node` objects and not JavaScript built in Lists at all. It should have `add`, `length`, `next`, `first` and `last` functions.

Add search functionality to the LinkedList.

## Formative assessment 4

Create a `Queue` Object (constructor function) that wraps a JavaScript list object. It should have two methods `enqueue` and `dequeue`. The `enqueue` method should put an item into the queue. The `dequeue` method should remove and return the item in front of the queue. The object should have a `length` function that returns the length of the queue.

## Formative assessment 5

Create a Binary Search Tree (BST) to which values can be added. Add `findMax` and `findMin` functions to it that can find the biggest and smallest values in the tree.

## Formative assessment 6

Create a number guessing game. First, one that needs users to guess the numbers. Then, one that guesses the numbers itself using the principles of the Binary Search algorithm.

## Summative 1

Create a `Queue` Object (constructor function) that **does not** use a JavaScript list object, but a `Node` object like the one used to create a LinkedList. It should have two methods `enqueue` and `dequeue`. The `enqueue` method should put an item into the queue. The `dequeue` method should remove and return the item at front of the queue. The object should have a `length` function that returns the length of the queue.

## Summative 2

Create a `Stack` Object that uses `Node` objects. The Stack object should have `push` and `pop` methods and a `depth` property. The `push` method should add an item to the stack. The `pop` method should return and remove the item that was added to the Stack last. The `depth` property should keep a count of the number of items on the Stack.

## Summative 3

Add sorting support to the LinkedList Object use a sorting algorithm of your choice.

## Summative 4

Given a list of 10 / 15 / 20 multiple choice questions about Search and Sort techniques answer at least 70 / 80% of the questions correct.

Topics to be covered: Abstract data structure attributes; Search Algorithm characteristics; Search Algorithm challenges; Data structure building theory; Data Sorting algorithm theory.
