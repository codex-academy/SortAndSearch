# Nodes and pointers

## Introduction

In the warm-up session you worked with JavaScript lists, swapping the list entries around. What if I told you had to do the first warm-up exercise again, but you weren't allowed to use JavaScript lists? How would you approach it?

**pregnant pause...**

You would need to create your own List. How would you do that?

**more silence**

Why not use JavaScript objects, to point to other JavaScript objects? How would that work?

## Nodes and pointers applied

How about creating a `Node` object that can contain some data and points to another `Node` object? In effect, that would create a list of inter-connected Objects where one Object points to the next one.

Let's try it out:

```javascript
var Node = function(data, next){
    this.data = data;
    this.next = next;
}
```

Let's recreate the list from the first exercise:

```javascript
// create this
// ['apple', 'pear', 'mango', 'banana']

//Create a list by using nested Nodes
var fruitList = new Node('apple', new Node('pear',
                                  new Node('mango',
                                  new Node('banana', null))));
```

Another way to create the list would be:

```javascript
    //First create all the Nodes
    var apple = new Node('apple', null),
        pear = new Node('pear', null),
        mango = new Node('mango', null),
        banana = new Node('banana', null);

    //now link the Nodes
    apple.next = pear;
    pear.next = mango;
    mango.next = banana;ÃŸ    
```

Now that you have a list of fruits, experiment a bit:

```javascript
//let's print out 'apple'
console.log(fruitList.data);

//let's print out 'pear'
console.log(fruitList.next.data);

// how can you print out 'mango'

```

**Try this:**

* Loop through all the nodes in `fruitList` and print out the fruit name;
    * how do you know you are at the last Node in the list?
* Swap the first Node with the second Node in `fruitList`;
* Swap the first Node with the last Node in `fruitList`;
* Compare the values in each Node with the next Node and swap the node around if the first Node's value is bigger than the next Node's value.

## Linked Lists

As you can see, it's possible to create a list of fruits without using JavaScript's list object.

The list of `Nodes` is very basic and cumbersome to work with, but using a `Node` object we can create a chain of nodes that reference each other.

Such a list of Nodes is called a Linked List. Each Node is linked to the next Node. The last Node in the list not linked to anything. As a result, you can traverse a Linked List by:

One also get `doubly Linked List` where list `Nodes` can point to both the next and the previous `Node` in the chain. This makes your Linked List data structure more flexible and easier to navigate.

**Pro's and Con's** What are the Pro's and Con's of a Linked List? How are a doubly Linked List beneficial?

## Beyond Linked List

Using a similar approach one can create various different data structures such as Queues, Stacks, Graphs and Trees using `Node` objects that link to each other. More about that later.
