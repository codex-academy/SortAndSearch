# Sorting

Sorting a list in Javascript is as easy as calling the `sort` function. You can specify how it should be sorted by passing it in a command function. But what is it doing behind the scenes?

A basic sort functions might compare each values in a list with each other and then swap the values around until there are no more values to be swapped.

# Sorting algorithms

There are various different sorting algorithms, an algorithm being a set of steps to achieve a certain goal or outcome. Some sorting algorithms are more efficient than others, they take less steps to complete sorting the data. The steps is how many times the algorithm needs to inspect the data to ensure the data is sorted.

## Selection sort

Selection sort is very similar to finding the biggest or smallest product for Nelisa. But you donâ€™t stop once you find the smallest/largest product you keep on going until you ordered all the values in the list.

## Bubble sort

When doing a Bubble sort the biggest or smallest number is bubbling towards the end of a lists. As it is comparing each item in a list to the item next to it and swapping the items around if needed. When there are no more items to swap the list is sorted.

**Todo:**

Add sorting support to your LinkedList class. Be sure that you can sort ascending or descending.

## Curious about more sort algorithms?

Here are two more.

Take a look at how Insertion sort work[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFG-XuyPYUQ)

And [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8hXR_Hvybo) is how the very efficient Merge sort algorithm works.
